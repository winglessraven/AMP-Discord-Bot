# AMP Discord Bot Plugin

A full featured Discord bot plugin for [AMP by Cubecoders](https://cubecoders.com/AMP) that can be used to display the server status in a dynamically updating info panel along with the ability to manage the server directly from Discord. 
* Use buttons or commands to start/stop/restart/kill/update/manage.
* Send console commands directly from Discord to your server.
* Send server output to a Discord channel.
* Track playtime of players.
* Assign permissions to a role so only select members can manage the server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The plugin cannot be used on ADS. It can only run on non-ADS instances.

# Configuration Steps

## Install Script
Thanks to [Bluscream](https://github.com/Bluscream) there is now a handy install script to take care of activating instances, downloading the plugin, and enabling it.

The script can be found [here](https://github.com/winglessraven/AMP-Discord-Bot/blob/master/install_script.py).

For instructions to run the script, see [here](https://github.com/winglessraven/AMP-Discord-Bot/wiki/How-to-Run-the-Install-Script).

## Configure AMP
Before the plugin can be used you need to configure AMP in a specific way.  **NOTE: The plugin cannot be used on ADS. It can only run on non-ADS instances.**
### Activate with a Developer Licence
* Request a developer licence from AMP via the licence portal https://manage.cubecoders.com/Login
* Once you have received the licence log into your server console and as the amp user run `ampinstmgr stop [ADS INSTANCE NAME]` followed by `ampinstmgr reactivate [INSTANCE NAME] [DEVELOPER KEY]`  where `[INSTANCE NAME]` is the name of your instance you want to set up a bot for and `[DEVELOPER KEY]` is the key received from CubeCoders.
* Start your ADS instance again with `ampinstmgr start [ADS INSTANCE NAME]`.

### Installing and Enabling the Plugin
* Edit the AMPConfig.conf file in the root folder of your instance (e.g. `/home/amp/.ampdata/instances/INSTANCENAME01/AMPConfig.conf`)
* Under AMP.LoadPlugins add `DiscordBotPlugin` to the list (e.g. `AMP.LoadPlugins=["FileManagerPlugin","EmailSenderPlugin","WebRequestPlugin","LocalFileBackupPlugin","CommonCorePlugin","DiscordBotPlugin"]`)
* In the plugins folder for your instance (e.g. `/home/amp/.ampdata/instances/INSTANCENAME01/Plugins/`) create a new folder called `DiscordBotPlugin` and insert the .dll file from the current [release](https://github.com/winglessraven/AMP-Discord-Bot/releases/latest "release")
* Restart your instance with `ampinstmgr restart [INSTANCE NAME]`
* Log in to your instance and you will see a new menu item under Configuration for the Discord Bot

![Menu Item](https://images2.imgbox.com/1f/1f/VHRYDACX_o.png "Menu Item")

## Configure your Discord Bot
### Create the Application
* Log in to https://discord.com/developers/applications with your Discord account.
* Click `New Application`
* Enter a name for your application and click `Create`

### Change Installation Settings
* Click `Installation` on the menu bar along the left, then deselect `User Install` and set `Install Link` to `None`
* Save your changes

### Bot Settings
* Click `Bot` on the menu bar along the left, then disable `Public Bot`
* Give your bot an icon and enable `Server Members Intent` (this is to ensure that cached member groups are not used if using permissions for controlling servers (start/stop/update/restart/kill)) AND `Message Content Intent` (this is for writing chat messages back to Minecraft servers if enabled)
* Save your changes
* Copy your bot token and paste it in the token field of the Discord Bot menu in AMP

### Configure Permissions and Add to your Discord Server
* Click the `OAuth2` option on the left hand menu
* Select `bot` and `applications.commands` followed by `Send Messages`,`Manage Messages`,`Embed Links`, and `Read Message History`
* Copy the resulting URL and paste into a new browser tab
> [!TIP]
> The resulting URL will be similar to this, but with your application ID under `client_id`:
> 
> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=12345&permissions=92160&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands
* Log in if nedded and add the bot to your Discord server by selecting it in the list
* If you plan to use pemissions for the server commands, create a new role on your Discord server to use later on.
